A practice with strings, concatenation, my first function declaration in JS, using console log, using back ticks, end embedding code with dollar sign '$' syntax.  

#### file: [03-objects-literal.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/03-objects-literal.js)
A practice with a person object, making new copies of the object, printing in console, also using 'console.table' printing format.  


#### file: [04-arrays.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/04-arrays.js)
A practice with arrays, how to add elements to them, using map and a function to create a new modified array.  


#### file: [05-functions.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/05-functions.js)
A practice with functions, creating them, arrow functions structure, syntax to return objects from arrow functions.  


#### file: [06-destructuring-obj.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/06-destructuring-obj.js)
A practice for destructuring objects, example with a person object, destructuring object attributes into 'const0 variables, how to print and specific key value using 'object.key' syntax. destructuring annidated objects.  

#### file: [07-destructuring-arrays.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/07-destructuring-arrays.js)
A practice for destructuring arrays, example with a person array, destructuring specific index positions with comma's separated spaces, creating a function that returns an array that contains a function inside, also destructuring a function inside an array.  

#### file: [08-import-export.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/08-import-export.js)
An import/export array's practice, and building fuctions using 'find' and 'filter' array methods.  

#### file: [09-promises.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/09-promises.js)
In this practice, we understand the importance of promises, how to set the response Timeout, how to use resolve, or reject commonly used method conventions.  

#### file: [10-fetch.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/10-fetch.js)
In this practice, we're working with an API, and doing calls to it with fetch method which returns a promise.
we apply 'then' and 'catch' events, and make some object's destructuring. finally we obtain a GIFT url from the API to be showed in our actual HTML's body.  

#### file: [11-async-await.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/11-async-await.js)
In this practice, we're working arrow functions with  'async' and 'await' to solving promises.  

#### file: [12-ternary.js](https://github.com/ronniebm/React-JS/blob/main/02-intro-javascript/src/bases/12-ternary.js)
In this practice, we're working with Ternary conditional operator in JavaScript, their structure and some short implementation.
