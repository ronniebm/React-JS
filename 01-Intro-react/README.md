# React-JS (nov.06.2020)  
Loading React-JS from index.html file, it's not the best practice, but this is for understanding/interacting purposes.  

### file:  index.html  
My very first introduction to REACT JS.  
- How to use REACT called as Script, this is not a common practice.  
- it's only for basic understanding purposes.  
- react.production, react DOM, and babel JavaScript compiler.
