# React-JS (nov.06.2020)  
Loading React-JS from index.html file, it's not the best practice, but this is for understanding/interacting purposes.  

### file:  index.html  
My very first introduction to REACT JS.  
- How to use REACT called as Script, this is not a common practice.  
- it's only for basic understanding purposes.  
- react.production, react DOM, and babel JavaScript compiler.  

### Scope inside HTML (Objectives):
- Create a DIV tag where some info is going to be displayed.
- How to specify inside HTML that code in the script should be compiled by BABEL to achieve JavaScript complete compatibility.
- build a h1TAG html block to be displayed.
- use of querySelector to render h1TAG inside an specified DIV tag.
